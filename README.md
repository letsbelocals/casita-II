# casita-II
The Casita sobre ruedas (little house on wheels), or simply Casita - II is our tiny house project constructed on a 20' (6 meter) trailer. I will attempt to document the progress here. While the Tiny House Movement has gained considerable popularity in recent years, I feel as though I've been working up to this project for quite some time now.
